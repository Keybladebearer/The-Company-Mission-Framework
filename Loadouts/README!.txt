These are the Non-Default Loadouts for use in TCMF Missions.
If you are familiar with out the TCMF uses loadouts, have fun. 

If not, this is the most effective way to choose the uniforms and arms of TCMF AI, as well as player units.
These documents decide everything that a unit is wearing, carrying, and using. The default loadouts in TCMF v6 are for Russian Federation Ground Forces, 
and United States Army Infantry. However, through the Gearscripts within, you can play as British Armed Forces Infantry, NAPA Insurgents, Takistani Militia, 
Russian VDV, United States Marines, or German Bundeswehr Mechanized Infantry. And that's just one author's. (Keyblade. Me. I wrote this too.) 

An easy way to select a gearscript is to add the filename to includedLoadouts.cpp (Do this with any plain text editor. Notepad++ is perferred.) with the command #include "LoadoutsNAPA.cpp" Save it, and in game, 
change in the Unit's INIT field from "RUS" to "NAPA," for example.

Tada! You've changed your Russian Infantry to Chernarus Based Insurgents.
If you require any help in this, contact Keyblade on steam or on teamspeak, and if he isn't available, ask any mission maker in TCOY.

Good Luck, and Have Fun! Mission Making is rewarding, we promise!
